# A Monopoly Simulator

A hacked-together Monopoly simulator.

```
$ ruby monopoly.rb
```

Running this command simulates a Monolopy game. Currently, players do not trade properties.

The simulator will run a game to completion. If no player obtains a Monopoly, the game generally goes on forever. Because of this, when all properties are sold, the game aborts and prints a summary. I'll add trading routines eventually.
